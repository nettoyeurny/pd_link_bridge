#X text 25 37 abl_link~ is a Pd external for iOS that integrates Ableton
Link into libpd. To support patching with abl_link~ outside of iOS
\, there is an abstraction \, also called abl_link~ \, that mimics
the behavior of the external (minus the actual Link functionality \,
of course).;

#X text 25 417 Note that the abstraction is just a quick hack to create
a reasonable patching experience with abl_link~ \; it is not trying
to be complete or even entirely correct. In particular \, apart from
the absence of actual Link functionality \, the tempo message will
reset the beat time (because it was easier to implement that way) \,
and the step outlet may not fire if the quantum is one or less (same
reason).;
#X text 25 320 The creation arguments \, all optional \, specify the
resolution (default 1) and the initial beat time (default 0) \, as
well as the quantum and tempo \, which will default to the current
Link session settings. If Link is already connected when the abl_link~
object is created \, the tempo parameter will be ignored. The link
external will perform a quantized launch on creation.;
#X text 25 262 abl_link~ responds to three methods \, for setting the
resolution of the step outlet (in steps per beat) \, the tempo (in
beats per minute) \, and for resetting the beat time and quantum by
having Link perform a quantized launch.;
#X text 25 192 Note that Link's beat time can sometimes go backwards.
When this happens \, the step outlet will fall silent until the beat
time moves forward again. The phase and beat outlets will output raw
values from Link so that patches can implement their own handling of
time going backwards.;

#X text 25 108 abl_link~ has four outlets \, which emit the index of
the current step (at the beginning of each step) \, as well as the
current phase \, beat time \, and tempo at each dsp tick. Phase and
beat time are Link concepts. The purpose of the step feature is to
generate events in Pd at a given rate (measured in steps per beat).
